# Puck

A local video file AirPlay service.

### What it does

Puck maintains a list of correctly encoded video files in a given directory,
and uses an AirPlay CLI command to stream said file to your AppleTV (or other
AirPlay device). Effectively, it's a lightweight (feather-light) media centre
for your non-iTunes files.

### How to use it

See the setup instructions for installing the app on the server side. Once
running, visit the app in your browser and click/tap on a video file and it'll
AirPlay it to your AirPlay device.

### Why not just setup and use Home Sharing?

It sucks. And, naturally, is less fun than writing your own solution.
